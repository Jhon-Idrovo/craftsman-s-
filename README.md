## FANTASY E-COMMERCE

The purpose of this site is to showcase and practice my habilities, with focus primarily on UI/X design.

The site iss based on Next.js.

# Technologies used:

- Shopify Storefront API: for retrieving the data and making payments easy and secure.
- Apollo: for querying the Shopify API (wich works with GraphQL)
- Tailwind: for styling

# SHOPIFY CONFIGURATION

    Since there aren't subcategories in shopify I had to make it for myself using prefixed on the categories.

Main-<category>: A principal category
<Category>-<subcategory>: a subcategory

Categories are collections in Shopify

Each product has its type which is used to cladify them in the right collection.

# Major Difficulties Overcomed

- Integration with the Shopify API using Apollo was difficult since there is a bug between the two. I found the rigth version of Apollo and with a careful implementation it works.
