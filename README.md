## FANTASY E-COMMERCE

The purpose of this site is to showcase and practice my habilities, with focus primarily on UI/X design.

The site iss based on Next.js.

# Technologies used:

- Shopify Storefront API: for retrieving the data and making payments easy and secure.
- Apollo: for querying the Shopify API (wich works with GraphQL)
- Tailwind: for styling

# Major Difficulties Overcomed

- Integration with the Shopify API using Apollo was difficult since there is a bug between the two. I found the rigth version of Apollo and with a careful implementation it works.
